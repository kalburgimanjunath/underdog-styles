## Strikethrough

Allows you to display a strikethrough on top of an element.
Use in place of `text-decoration: line-through` when you want a line-through to
span multiple elements.

<span class="strikethrough">
  Vehicula cillum illum reprehenderit! Laboriosam sapiente? Urna ullamcorper donec eleifend.
</span>

```html
<span class="strikethrough">
  Vehicula cillum illum reprehenderit! Laboriosam sapiente? Urna ullamcorper donec eleifend.
</span>
```
